Movie Platform Availability Prediction
Principal Goals of the Project
Imagine opening Netflix on a Friday night, scrolling through Amazon Prime on Saturday, and dipping into Disney+ on Sunday. Some films follow you everywhere, while others seem to vanish from one service and reappear on another. Why?
Our project follows each film on its journey. We start with basic facts: its IMDb rating, release year, genre, director, and main cast, and watch where it ends up: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, or nowhere at all.
We want to see if a movie’s good reviews or its well-known director and actors help it land on the big streaming shelves. Is a high IMDb score a golden ticket? Do certain genres or release years get picked first? Or are there other reasons we don’t yet, see?
By the end, we want to explain how movies move from initial release to streaming menus and why some always show up while others never do.
Research Questions
Are movies with high IMDb ratings and notable attributes, such as director, cast, and genre, more likely to be available on Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Disney+?
